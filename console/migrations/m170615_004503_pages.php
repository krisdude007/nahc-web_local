Accidents happen. And by design, they are rarely anticipated or expected. But you can prepare for them. As an NAHC Member, you can select from a variety of affordable accident-related plans that deliver financial help in times of need. 

## Accident Disability Insurance ##

NAHC’s Accident Disability Insurance (ADI) covers expenses related to accidental injuries. ADI covers out-of-pocket expenses and medical costs beyond what your existing health insurance plan covers. Disability Insurance, also known as Disability Income Insurance or Temporary Disability Insurance, provides a weekly, tax-free source of revenue only in the event of total disability.   If you are unable to work due to a disability, it can assist in covering the costs of basic daily needs like food, rent, utilities, gasoline, or car payments.

## Accident Hospital Indemnity ##

Accident Hospital Indemnity (AHI) pays benefits when an accident results in hospitalization. AHI is specifically for policy-covered accidents that require a hospital admission. AHI pays for room and board, miscellaneous hospital expenses and general nursing charges, although it does not cover 100% of these expenses . AHI is specifically for accidents that require hospital admission, accident-related inpatient rehabilitation, and hospital stays.

## Accident Medical Expenses ##

Accident Medical Expense (AME) can help you pay for out-of-pocket expenses related medical expenses that result from accidents, such as deductibles and copays for primary care visits and physical therapy, as well as everyday living expenses that may not be covered under your primary health plan, like transportation, lawn care and child care. Benefits are paid directly to you, not to the hospital or facility where you are being treated, and you have discretion over how and where the money is used.

## Accidental Death & Dismemberment ##

Accidental Death & Dismemberment (AD&D) pays a lump sum in the event of an unforeseen accident that results in a fatality or dismemberment. An AD&D policy will pay the policy’s face value, or death benefit, to the beneficiary named in the policy if the insured accidentally dies or suffers dismemberment, per the schedule of benefits. 
';

        $ins2 = '# Critical Illness Insurance #

There’s no more urgent time for financial support than following the diagnosis of a critical illness. Critical Illness Policies from NAHC pay a lump-sum, cash benefit to help cover your out-of-pocket expenses up to the amount provided by the benefit level you choose. If the total amount of your medical bills is less than your benefit maximum, you can use the remaining funds to care for any other expenses you’ve incurred, such as to help pay your mortgage or rent, to relieve debts or pay for any necessary alterations to your home that might be required for wheelchair accessibility or ascending stairs. 

Critical Illness Plans pay benefits for the first diagnosis of a covered illnesses in three categories, paying one cash benefit for each category with three lump-sum payments available. It provides financial protection for you and your dependents to help with daily living expenses. For instance, it could be used to care for overdue mortgage payments that may have been missed due to a critical illness, a physically disabling condition, or death. It provides an established level of catastrophic coverage to help offset the higher costs of living that are unavoidably incurred during the course of a critical illness.

Claim benefits can be applied to:

- Lump sum payments for living expenses
- Funding for health-related lifestyle changes
- Coverage for major surgical procedures
- Payment for recuperation aids and expenses
- Replaces lost income due to diminished earning ability

Some NAHC Vision Plans also offer discounts on elective surgeries for vision correction, such as LASIK and PRK.

        $ins4 = '# Dental Insurance #

Your teeth impact more than how well you chew. When not properly cared for, they can compromise your health and lead to a variety of conditions and illnesses elsewhere inside your body. So, it’s important that you properly plan for, and care for, your dental health and hygiene. 
Health Insurance Policies typically cover ever part of your body except your teeth. With crowns costing $1,500 or more, root canals running anywhere from $300 to $1,000 or higher, and even routine cleanings costing as more than $100, NAHC offers Dental Insurance Coverage that helps cover those costs.

Our plans are more flexible than traditional Dental Insurance Policies, especially if you live in a rural or remote area where a traditional PPO network is not as robust. Unlike traditional plans where you can be responsible for as much 50% of the cost of care, with an indemnity plan from NAHC, you’re only responsible for the difference between what the dentist charges and what your plan pays.

The seven basic areas that NAHC Dental Plans cover are:
Preventive Care – includes your bi-annual cleanings and office visits, among other basic dental procedures. 
Restorative Care – when more work is indicated; usually requires some form of out-of-pocket payment. Examples of restorative procedures are the placement of crowns or fillings. 
Endodontics – procedures that will result, in most cases, with a fee. Root canals are among the many endodontics procedures that our plans cover. 
Oral Surgery – includes procedures such as tooth extractions and gum or bone grafts. 
Periodontics – scaling and root planning, commonly called “deep cleaning”, is the most common periodontics procedure, but there are others. 
Prosthodontics – mostly used for the elderly who may need dentures, bridges, or implants. 
Orthodontics – sometimes referred to as “cosmetic dentistry”, this area of practice involves the installation and care of braces, retainers, and other dental-alignment procedures. 
Coverage benefits include:

- No network provisions
- More flexible than traditional plans
- Lower co-pays (in most cases)';
