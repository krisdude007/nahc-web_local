                <h1>Accident Disability Insurance (ADI)</h1>
                <p>NAHC’s Accident Disability policies cover expenses related to accidental injuries. They care for out-of-pocket
                    expenses and medical costs beyond what your existing health insurance plan covers. Disability Insurance, also
                    known as Disability Income Insurance or Temporary Disability Insurance, provides a monthly, tax-free source
                    of revenue. If you are unable to work due to a disability, it can assist in covering the costs of basic daily needs
                    like food, rent, utilities, gasoline, or car payments.<br>
