                <h3>What is Accident Disability Insurance?</h3>
                <p>If you become disabled from a covered accident and are unable to work, ADI
                insurance is designed to replace portions of your lost income. No one plans on
                having an accident or becoming disabled, that's why this policy can help you if
                you experience one of life's mishaps. During a disability, you can be caught in
                the death spiral of increased expenses and decreased income, having an ADI
                plan helps level the playing field. After a 30-day elimination period, weekly benefit payments will be made directly to you.</p>
                <p>This extremely valuable benefit pays weekly benefit checks from $250 to $500,
                dependent on the benefit level chosen. These weekly benefits continue until a
                covered person is no longer disabled, fails to provide certificate from a
                physician that he/she remains disabled, reaches the end of the maximum benefit period or dies.</p>

                <h3>What are the two types of coverage?</h3>
                <p>There are two primary types of disability insurance—short term and long term. Each offers distinct terms and coverage guidelines that are essential to understand before purchasing a policy. Though short- and long-term coverages are "distinct," they are also "complimentary" programs, designed to cover different types of disability.</p>
                <p>Short-term disability insurance<br>
                    A short-term policy typically is designed to replace 80% or more of your gross income for a short duration of time. Kruk notes that duration may range from 60 to 180 days, depending on the policy. For example, if recovery from surgery will keep you out of work for several weeks or months, short-term disability can replace the income you lose while you’re out of work. You typically need to wait for an “elimination period”—say, five or 10 days—before the coverage kicks in. Employers often offer short-term disability insurance to their employees, and many subsidize that coverage (some pay the full cost), though the subsidized portion may be taxable to the employee.</p>

                <p>Long-term disability insurance<br>
                    What happens if your short-term disability coverage runs out and you’re still out of work? In that case, you’d turn to long-term disability, which typically kicks in after you’ve been out of work for an extended period of time, such as 180 days. Long-term disability policies are quite different from their short-term peers. In particular, long-term policies typically cover only about 60% of your salary. Fortunately, the coverage can last for years—even through the rest of your life, depending on the design of the policy.<br>
                    For example, say you suffered extensive injuries in a car accident and were unable to return to work for nine months. Typically, after six months, long-term disability would begin to replace a portion of your income. Once you return to work, the disability coverage will end. Alternatively, say you are diagnosed with a degenerative disease, such as multiple sclerosis, that eventually will make you unable to work. Your disability coverage will continue to pay a portion of your salary for a set amount of time—typically until age 65 or through the end of your life, depending on the policy.</p>

                <h3>Who needs Accident Disability Insurance?</h3>
                <p>All wage earners, that would face financial difficulty if they were left unable to
                work, due to an accident. Unlike Supplemental Security Income, through the
                Social Security Administration, which can take up to two years to receive if you
                are approved, private disability insurance can start after a short 30-day
                elimination period after a qualified disability due to an accident. Some workers
                may be covered by disability insurance through their employers, but many
                workers have limited coverage or no coverage at all. Individuals with little or no
                coverage can buy private disability insurance to protect their earning power
                and provide for their families should they be prevented from working by an
                    accidental disability.</p>
                <p>Unfortunately, disabilities are surprisingly common. One in three women and
                one in four men will have a disability that keeps them out of work for 90 days
                or more at some point during their working lifetime, according to The Life and
                Health Insurance Foundation for Education. “People need to understand the
                serious nature of how a physical disability can create a financial disability, as
                    well.”</p>

                <h3>Who doesn’t need Accident Disability Insurance?</h3>
                <p>Accident Disability Insurance is of benefit to everyone. However, to qualify for
                    the benefits of this plan, you must be a wage earner. ADI replaces a portion of
                    your lost income after a 30-day elimination period. People that are retired,
                    unemployed or don’t have documented employment would not benefit from
                    having an ADI policy.</p>
                <h3>What is normally included as coverage in an Accident Disability Insurance policy?</h3>
                    <p>Disability insurance, also referred to as disability income insurance or
                    temporary disability insurance, provides a monthly tax-free benefit. This can
                    help you cover things like food, rent, utilities, or car payments if you are unable
                    to work due to a disability. The benefit is available for any covered accident,
                    such as a fall, sports injury, or traffic accident, that results in the insured
                    becoming totally disabled. The benefit is paid regardless of any other disability
                    insurance the employee or spouse may have.</p>
                <p>ADI pays a portion of a worker's salary if that worker becomes disabled and is
                    unable to work at his or her job. </p>
                <p>According to the Council for Disability Awareness, at least one out of
                    every four workers will become disabled at some point during their
                    working career. This disability can come from accidents or injuries on the
                    job, as well as from other debilitating illnesses such as cancer or a heart
                    attack. Disability insurance such as ADI can reimburse disabled workers
                    for some of the income they lose while recovering from illnesses and
                    injuries.</p>

                <h3>What is normally excluded as coverage in an Accident Disability Insurance policy?</h3>
                <p>Accident disability insurance is a limited benefit policy. It provides disability
                    benefits only and does not provide basic hospital, basic medical, or major
                    medical insurance. This coverage does not constitute comprehensive health
                    insurance (often referred to as "major medical coverage") and does not satisfy
                    the requirement for Minimum Essential Coverage under the Affordable Care
                    Act. Failing to maintain Minimum Essential Coverage may result in a tax penalty.</p>

                <h3>Why get Disability Insurance?</h3>
                <p>Unlike Social Security disability, which covers most workers after they reach a certain age and is capped at a maximum monthly payment regardless of the worker's salary, private disability insurance can cover about 70 percent of a worker's salary at any age when a disability arises. Some workers may be covered by disability insurance through their employers, but many workers have limited coverage or no coverage at all. Individuals with little or no coverage can buy private disability insurance in order to protect their earning power and provide for their families should they be prevented from working by an illness or injury.</p>

                <h3>How much does Disability Insurance Cost?</h3>
                <p>The cost of disability insurance can vary widely depending on a variety of factors such as:<br>
                    the worker's occupation;<br>
                    the worker's health;<br>
                    the worker's lifestyle habits, such as tobacco or alcohol use;<br>
                    the amount of monthly benefits the worker intends to receive; and<br>
                    the disability insurance policy's options.<br></p>

                <p>Compared with other types of insurance, such as life insurance or auto insurance, disability insurance can be expensive, with some estimates Join Now premiums at several thousand dollars per year. People with a higher risk of injury or illness, such as those with dangerous jobs or preexisting health conditions, likely will pay higher premiums. However, depending on an individual's circumstances, the cost of disability insurance can outweigh the risk of losing one's home or not being able to provide for one's family in the event of a long-term disability.</p>

                <h3>How do I get Disability Insurance?</h3>
                <p>Most people who buy private disability insurance do so through an insurance broker, just as one would if buying life insurance or homeowner's insurance. In order to receive an accurate quote, you will have to provide your insurance broker with information about your occupation, your income, your age, any existing health conditions you currently have, and any dependents you support with your wages. Based on this information, the broker will assess the likelihood that you might become disabled and determine a monthly or annual premium you would pay to receive benefit payments you desire.</p>

                <h3>How does it work?</h3>
                <p>Employees and their spouses choose a flat dollar weekly benefit amount of coverage. If a serious injury occurs, we start paying the insured person once the Elimination Period is satisfied.</p>

                <h3>How do I get Disability Insurance?</h3>
                <p>The benefit is available for any covered accident, such as a fall, sports injury, or traffic accident, that results in the insured becoming Totally Disabled. The benefit is paid regardless of any other disability insurance the employee or spouse may have.</p>

                <h3>Limitations & Exclusions</h3>
                <p>An accident is defined as a sudden, unexpected and unintended event, which
                    results in bodily injury, which is independent of disease or bodily infirmity or
                    any other cause. This policy will not pay benefits for injuries received prior to
                    the effective date of coverage that are aggravated or re-injured by any event
                    that occurs after the effective date.</p>

                <p>No benefits will be provided for an accident that is caused by or occurs as a
                    result of: intentionally self-inflicted bodily injury, suicide or attempted suicide,
                    whether sane or insane; participation in any form of flight aviation other than
                    as a fare-paying passenger in a fully licensed/passenger-carrying aircraft; any

                    armed forces; participation in any contest of speed in a power driven vehicle
                    for pay or profit; participation in any activity or event while under the influence
                    of any narcotic unless administered by a physician or taken according to the
                    physician’s instructions; participation in, or attempting to participate in, a
                    felony, riot or insurrection (A felony is as defined by the law of the jurisdiction
                    in which the activity takes place.); participation in any sport for pay or profit;
                    participation in parachuting, bungee jumping, rappelling, mountain climbing or
                    hang gliding. Benefits will not be provided for medical treatment for an
                    accident received outside the United States or its territories. Benefits will not
                    be paid for services rendered by a member of the immediate family of a
                    covered person.</p>

                <p>Benefits provided will only be paid for one disability at a time, even if the
                    covered person becomes totally disabled due to more than one injury or more
                    than one covered accident. Benefits are not payable during any period of time
                    the covered person is incarcerated in any type of penal institution or due to any
                    accident that occurs while the covered person is incarcerated in any type penal
                    institution. The covered person must be age 69 or under; and total disability
                    must begin within 90 days of the covered accident. For covered persons with
                    full-time employment, totally disabled (total disability) means the covered
                    person is unable to perform the material and substantial duties of his or her
                    occupation due to Injuries received in a covered accident.</p>

                <p>Full-time employment means the covered person works at a job an average of
                    15 or more hours per week for wages or benefits. For covered persons without
                    full-time employment, totally disabled (total disability) means that, due to
                    Injuries received in a covered accident, the covered person is unable to safely
                    perform two or more Activities of Daily Living without another person’s standby
                    assistance or verbal cueing. The inability to perform a task must be generally
                    recognized by the medical profession as a consequence of the disabling
                    accident. Activities of daily living, as defined in the rider, are: continence;
                    transferring; dressing; toileting; and eating. </p>

                <h4 class="modal-title" id="prod2Label">Accident Hospital Indemnity (AHI)</h4>
            </div>
            <div class="modal-body">
                <h3>What is AHI Insurance?</h3>
                <p>Health insurance pays for specific medical services after deductible or copay
                amounts are satisfied. By contrast, AHI insurance triggers benefit payments
                when an accident results in hospitalization. AHI is specifically for covered
                accidents that require a hospital admission, and pays for room and board,
                miscellaneous hospital expenses and general nursing charges. Bundling this
                    benefit with the other accident benefits provides superior coverage.</p>
                <p>Accident hospital indemnity insurance (AHI) is specifically for accidents that
                require hospital admission, accident-related inpatient rehabilitation, and
                hospital stays. This could be for an emergency room visit to a hospital due to
                a concussion received in a fall at home with a required overnight stay at the
                hospital for observation – to a car accident causing a broken back requiring
                surgery at the hospital and a week-long stay for recovery and rehab. It means
                that the insurance company will pay a set amount each time the insured
                    receives a covered service and it is paid directly to the policy holder.</p>

                <h3>How can AHI Help?</h3>
                <p>AHI coverage can complement your health insurance to help you pay for the costs associated with a hospital stay. It can also provide funds that can be used to help pay the out-of-pocket expenses your medical plan may not cover, such as co-insurance, co-pays, and deductibles. Even a minor trip to the hospital can present you with the unexpected expenses and medical bills. And though you may have major medical insurance, your plan may only pay a portion of what your entire stay entails.</p>

                <h3>Who needs AHI Insurance?</h3>
                <p>Accident hospital indemnity insurance would be a good supplement to those
                who have high deductibles for the hospitalization part of their major-medical
                insurance policy – or a good alternative for those who have no accident and
                hospital benefits from any of their insurance policies. AHI insurance provides
                financial help to enhance your current insurance coverage. Your health
                insurance plan may pay only a portion of the total expenses a hospital stay or
                    medical treatment requires.</p>

                <h3>What Is an Indemnity Benefit?</h3>
                <p>It means that the insurance company, such as NAHC, will pay a set amount each time the insured receives a covered service. The same amount is paid regardless of the fees charged by the provider.</p>

                <h3>What is normally included as coverage in an AHI policy?</h3>
                <p>No one plans to get injured – be prepared if it happens to you. This plan provides lump sum benefits for hospital confinement, outpatient surgery, and accidental injury. Hospital Cash Plan is a hospital indemnity plan – which means it pays a set amount if you’re confined in a hospital. The benefits are paid directly to you or your designee.</p>

                <h3>How is the AHI benefit paid?</h3>
                <p>When you experience a hospital confinement the result of an accident or outpatient surgery the result of an accident, or an emergency room visit, you submit a claim form along with the receipts for services received. You or your designee will receive a lump-sum payment as described in the policy. If you have a major medical plan it may have a rider for hospitalization, but it may have a high deductible such as $2,000 or even $6,000 which would require you to come out-of-pocket to meet the deductible part of the hospital expense. An AHI policy would cover the required deductible payment.</p>

                <h3>Who does not need AHI Insurance?</h3>
                <p>Those who have a major-medical insurance policy with no deductible.
                Unfortunately, these policies are very rare because most come with a high
                    deductible and out of pocket expense.</p>



                <h3>What is normally included as coverage in an AHI policy?</h3>
                <p>No one plans to get injured or become hospitalized – be prepared if it happens
                to you. This plan provides a daily sum of benefits for hospital confinement. AHI
                means it pays a set amount if you’re confined in a hospital, depending on the
                    level that you choose. The benefits are paid directly to you or your designee.</p>

                <h3>What is normally excluded as coverage in an AHI policy?</h3>
                <p>Any medical expenses that aren’t a direct result of being confined in the
                hospital on an inpatient basis. This plan does not pay for diagnostic exams, ER
                visits or outpatient surgeries. However, combined with plans that do, it can
                    provide a great level of protection from life’s mishaps.</p>
                <h3>Limitations and Exclusions</h3>
                <p>This product provides limited benefits and is not designed as a substitute for
                health insurance, but as a supplement to it. It is not comprehensive major
                medical insurance and does not satisfy the requirement for minimum essential
                coverage under the Affordable Care Act (ACA). It may not be appropriate for
                    Medicaid recipients.</p>
                <p>The AHI policy will not pay benefits concerning a preexisting condition unless
                the benefits are for services rendered after coverage under the contract has
                been in force for 12 months from the issue date or for 12 months from the most
                recent reinstatement date. Elimination Period – The contract has an elimination
                period. We do not pay benefits during the elimination period. Waiting Period –
                The contract has a 30- day waiting period. We do not pay benefits during the
                waiting period. Confinement, treatment and related services for sickness during
                the waiting period are not eligible for payment. For sickness diagnosed before
                the end of the waiting period, benefits will only be payable for confinement,
                treatment and related services occurring 12 months after the issue date. The
                waiting period will be waived for newborns added after coverage is in force for
                    ten months following the issue date.</p>
                <p>This description of benefits is intended only to highlight your benefits and
                should not be relied upon to fully determine coverage. There may be other

                <h3>What is AME Insurance?</h3>
                <p>An AME insurance policy can help you pay for out-of-pocket accident related
                medical expenses – such as deductibles and copays for ER visits, primary care
                visits, physical therapy and prescription expenses. After the deductible,
                benefits are payable for medical expenses incurred as the result of each
                    covered accident. These benefits are paid directly to you.</p>
                <p>The policy is:<br>
                Comprehensive: You’re covered 24 hours a day, 7 days a week, whether you’re
                at work or on your own time.<br>
                Convenient: Benefits are paid directly to you, not to the hospital or facility
                where you are being treated.<br>
                Comforting: This policy is yours, independent of your employer. You can switch
                    jobs but keep the same AME insurance policy.<br></p>
                <h3>Who needs AME Insurance?</h3>
                <p>As major medical costs go up, consumers are increasing their deductibles and
                maximum out-of-pocket exposure in an effort to lower their monthly premium.
                Supplemental plans such as AME are a way for consumers to lessen the impact
                    of the increased out of pocket limits.</p>
                <p>Four out of ten people are treated in emergency rooms every year. The typical
                length of a hospital stay is five days – and costs are over $10,000. That’s more
                than two month’s income for the average American family! Hence AME
                insurance can protect one’s finances in the event of an accident medial
                    emergency.</p>
                <h3>Who doesn’t need AME Insurance?</h3>
                <p>Those with a major comprehensive medical insurance policy that has coverage
                for hospitalization due to accidents may not need AME insurance. But even
                with this type coverage, those major-medical policies make payments to the
                hospital. With a supplemental AME policy, the payments are made directly to
                    you and you have discretion over use of the money.</p>

                <h3>What is normally included as coverage in an AME Insurance policy?</h3>
                <p>An accident medical expense policy can help you pay for out-of-pocket
                accident related medical expenses. Medical Expense Policies traditionally
                reimburse expenses such as doctor visits while in the hospital (hospital
                expense) and are usually expanded to include payment for office visits,
                diagnostic x-rays, laboratory charges, ambulance, nursing expenses when not
                    hospitalized.</p>
                <p>The AME policy will reimburse back for the usual and customary charges for
                medically necessary covered medical services, subject to a small deductible,
                incurred by the covered person resulting from a covered accident. The first
                treatment or service must occur within 90 days of the covered accident and all
                subsequent treatments must be incurred within 52 weeks of the covered
                accident. Benefits received cannot be higher than out-of-pocket expenses
                incurred.<p></p>

                coverage provides extra security by helping to pay your medical bills when you
                need help most.<br><br>

                <h3>What is normally excluded as coverage in an AME Insurance
                    policy?</h3>
                <p>The policy provides limited accident insurance only. The accident expense
                policy provides limited benefit coverage for an accidental injury only. The
                policy does not provide coverage for legal liability. It does not provide basic
                hospital, basic medical or major medical insurance. This is an accident only
                    policy and does not provide benefits for loss due to sickness or illness.</p>

                <p>In the event of the first diagnosis of a critical illness, CI insurance will provide a lumpsum,
                cash benefit to help you pay your out-of-pocket expenses up to the benefit level
                you choose. If your medical bill is less than your chosen benefit level, you can use the
                leftover funds in any way you like, such as to help pay for your mortgage or rent,
                debts, or pay for alterations to your home such as wheelchair access should
                you need it. This plan pays benefits for the first diagnosis of covered illnesses in three
                categories. It pays one cash benefit per category, with three lump-sum payments
                    available.</p>
                <p>CI insurance can provide financial protection to the policyholder or their
                dependents on daily living expenses, or the repayment of a mortgage for
                instance, due to the policyholder contracting a critical illness condition or on
                the death of the policyholder, from a critical illness . CI provides a set-level of
                catastrophic coverage to help offset the high costs incurred if you or your
                spouse develop a covered critical illness.
                    The finances received could be used to:<br>
                    • Pay for the costs of the care and treatment;<br>
                    • Pay for recuperation aids;<br>
                    • Replace any lost income due to a decreasing ability to earn; or even<br>
                    • Fund for a change in lifestyle.<br>
                </p>
                <p>Critical illness insurance pays a lump-sum, tax-free, cash payment if you are
                diagnosed with and satisfy the survival period for any one of the critical
                illnesses covered by your policy. It's just that simple. One check for the full
                amount. Some policies will even pay you multiple times. If you are diagnosed
                with cancer you get paid. Two years later, you have a heart attack you get paid
                    again.</p>
                <h3>Who needs Critical Illness Insurance?</h3>
                <p>Serious illness takes more than a physical and emotional toll; it can impact your
                finances. Critical illness Insurance can help manage that financial burden, so you
                can focus on what is most important, your health. The chance of getting
                diagnosed with cancer or having a heart attack is heightened for people over
                age 40. In fact, per the American Cancer Society, one in two men and one in
                    three women develop cancer in their lifetime.</p>
                <p>Those covered by a high-deductible health plan may need assistance funding
                the deductible in the event of a major illness. Critical illness Insurance can help
                pay the deductible, out-of-pocket cost or cost of specialty drugs. People close
                to retirement could see a lifetime of financial preparation wiped out by a serious
                medical condition. Critical illness Insurance can help you meet financial
                obligations without having to dip into savings, an IRA or 401k. The impact of a
                serious medical condition may also be felt in the form of lost wages for both
                the patient and the caregiver. This may make it difficult for a family to afford
                college tuition for a child, fund retirement or even remain in the family home.
                A critical illness, such as cancer or a heart attack, is not only a devastating
                physical blow, but can be a severe financial blow. In fact, a recent Harvard
                Business School study showed that 62% of all bankruptcies are the result of a
                medical issue, and 78% of people who went bankrupt because of medical costs
                had comprehensive health insurance at the time of the illness. With statistics
                like these, it’s obvious that many Americans are simply not prepared for the
                    financial effects of a critical illness.</p>
                <p>While life insurance may provide a benefit in the event of an untimely death, most
                policies don’t provide protection if you survive a serious illness. Critical illness
                Insurance provides a benefit if you experience one of the following:<br>
                    • Cancer<br>
                    • Heart Attack<br>
                    • Stroke<br>
                    • Major Organ Transplant<br>
                    • Coronary Artery Bypass<br>
                    • Kidney (Renal) Failure<br>
                    • Coma<br>
                    • Paralysis<br>
                    These could vary by state.</p>
                <h3>Who doesn’t need Critical Illness Insurance?</h3>
                <p>You might not need it if:<br>
                • you have enough savings to fall back on and can adequately cover
                expenses such as bills, loans, medical costs or a mortgage<br>
                • you have a partner who can cover living costs and any shared
                commitments, like a mortgage<br>
                You might already have some cover included in other products or work
                    benefits.</p>

                <h3>What is Vision Insurance?</h3>
                <p>Vision insurance helps offset the costs of routine eye exams and helps pay for
                vision correction wear, like eyeglasses, that may be prescribed by physicians
                or eye-care specialists. Vision insurance is generally considered supplemental
                insurance, which means that consumers generally buy vision insurance in
                    addition to other types of medical insurance policies.</p>
                <p>But unlike major medical insurance policies that may provide unlimited benefits
                after a certain co-pays and deductibles are met, most vision insurance plans are
                discount plans or wellness benefit plans that provide specific benefits and
                    discounts for an annual premium.</p>
                <p>Having access to vision insurance allows you to have regular eye exams. Annual
                eye exams are about much more than healthy vision. These exams can help
                identify the early signs of serious health conditions, like diabetes and high blood
                pressure. The vision plans available through NAHC offer this and much more.
                Prescription lenses are available for a copay, allowances are provided for
                frames and contacts, and discounts are available for sunglasses and laser vision
                    correction. It is easy to see the benefits in these plans.</p>

                <h3> How often do you visit the eye doctor?</h3>
                <p>You probably see your primary care physician once a year, and your dentist twice a year. But how often do you see your eye doctor? Vision is the most valued of the five senses, and yet Americans don’t seem to be making regular eye exams a priority.</p>

                <p>These annual exams allow your doctor to detect changes in the front of your eye so alterations can be made to your eyeglass or contact lens prescription. However, your doctor also needs to look at the back of your eye, the retina, to check that it is healthy and not damaged or showing signs of disease. Many eye diseases, if detected early, can be treated successfully without total vision loss.</p>

                <h3>Who needs Vision Insurance?</h3>
                <p>Everyone that currently wears glasses or contacts, or encounters trouble
                reading fine print or seeing things at a distance would benefit from having
                vision insurance. Without vision coverage, an exam and prescription glasses
                can cost $300 or more. Regular eye exams are important. The VSP WellVision
                Exam is more than just a quick eye check. VSP doctors get to know you and your
                eyes. They take the time to look for vision problems and signs of other health
                    conditions too. Plus, you’ll get plenty of eyewear choices you’ll love.</p>

                <p>Your eyes not only affect how you see, but how you feel. Caring for your
                vision can lead to a better quality of life, including:<br>
                • Fewer headaches<br>
                • Better performance at school<br>
                • Less computer eye strain<br>
                • More effectiveness at work<br>
                • Better performance in sports<br>
                </p>
                <h3>Who doesn’t need Vision Insurance?</h3>
                <p>Those who have a comprehensive group health plan through their employer
                that also has some dental benefits and the lucky few who have perfect eyesight
                and who may think they do not need annual check-ups with eye doctors. Even
                the perfect eyesight folks can be beset by cataracts and other eye diseases and
                    an annual or bi-annual visit to the eye doctor would test for these conditions.</p>
                <h3>What is normally included in Vision Insurance?</h3>
                <p>The OptimumVision program includes money-saving vision services through
                VSP network doctors. The VSP network doctor list includes highly skilled and
                professionally certified optometrists and ophthalmologists. Whether your VSP
                doctor is an optometrist or ophthalmologist, you’ll receive a comprehensive
                    vision exam and you can purchase glasses and contacts in their office.</p>

                <h3>What is Normally excluded in Vision Insurance?</h3>
                <p>The following represents what is normally excluded in vision insurance:<br>

                • Eye surgery for the correction of vision, including radial keratotomy, LASIK

                which would be covered for non-tinted lenses.<br><br>

                For an eye exam which:<br>
                • Is required by an employer as a condition of employment; or<br>
                • An employer is required to provide under a labor agreement; or<br>
                • Is required by any law of a government.<br>
                • Prescription or over-the-counter drugs or medicines.<br>
                • Special vision procedures, such as orthoptics, vision therapy or vision training.<br>

                • Special supplies such as nonprescription sunglasses and subnormal vision aids.<br>

                <h3>What is Dental Insurance?</h3>
                <p>With a dental insurance plan, you pay premiums, co-pays and/or deductibles,
                and the insurance pays the remainder directly to the dentist or through a
                reimbursement. Through an NAHC membership, an indemnity dental plan
                allows consumers to receive services from any dental provider, with no waiting
                    period.</p>
                <p>There are no network provisions, and consumers are reimbursed for a specific
                amount of a service rendered, regardless of who provides it. For example, when
                someone covered by an indemnity plan receives a dental cleaning, his or her
                plan pays a flat amount for the service. Any charge above that amount is the
                    consumer’s responsibility.</p>
                <p>These plans can be more flexible than traditional dental insurance, especially
                for people living in rural areas or locations where a traditional PPO network is
                not as robust. Unlike traditional plans where the insured is responsible for as
                much 50% of the cost of care, with an indemnity plan the insured is only
                responsible for the difference between what the dentist charges and the plan
                    pays.</p>
                <h3>Who Needs Dental Insurance?</h3>
                <p>Your health insurance covers just about everything except your teeth. Much
                like your car, it doesn't take much to spend a thousand dollars or more on dental
                work. A crown may cost $1,500, and a root canal might run you $300 to
                $1,000. Even a simple cleaning will likely come in at more than $100. Dentists
                    aren't cheap and that's why it’s appropriate to have dental insurance.</p>
                <h3>Who Doesn’t Need Dental Insurance?</h3>
                <p>Those that have a comprehensive employer healthcare insurance policy with
                some dental care benefits may not need a separate individual dental insurance
                policy. Those with perfect teeth may not need dental insurance but even a
                basic cleaning of the teeth and a check for cavities can be relatively expensive,
                    and the more major dental work can be expensive.</p>
                <h3>What is Normally included in Dental Insurance?</h3>
                <p>Dental insurance plans typically have "tiers" of coverage, starting with basic
                options meant to cover the average expenses associated with hygiene. Your
                employer (or you, if you're going to bear the entire cost of insurance) can opt
                for orthodontic coverage, which includes more expensive options like braces,
                    casts and referrals to orthodontic specialists.</p>
                <p>There are seven basic areas of dental care that plans cover. They are as follows:<br>
                1. Preventive Care – includes your bi-annual cleanings and office visits, among other
                basic dental procedures.<br>
                2. Restorative Care – require more work and usually require some form of out-of-pocket
                payment. Examples of restorative procedures could be a crown or filling.<br>
                3. Endodontics – procedures that will result - in most cases - with a fee. Root canals are
                one of the many endodontics procedures which plans cover.<br>
                4. Oral Surgery – includes procedures such as tooth removals.<br>
                5. Periodontics – scaling and root planing (also known as a deep cleaning) is the most
                common one, but there are others.<br>
                6. Prosthodontics – mostly used for the elderly who are in need of dentures and/or
                bridges.<br>
                7. Orthodontics – sometimes referred to as “cosmetic dentistry” procedures, braces,
                retainers and other teeth correctors fall into this category.<br>
                </p>
                <h3>What is Normally Excluded in Dental Insurance?</h3>
                <p>The most costly processes, such as bridges, crowns and dentures would be
                classified as “major procedures”. They require a greater out-of-pocket cost as
                opposed to basic and preventive procedures. Usually, these procedures are
                covered 50 percent or less by your dental plan. Generally speaking, cosmetic
                dental procedures are not covered under an insurance plan, especially one
                    managed by an employer.</p>
                <h3>Limitations & Exclusions</h3>
                <p>The exclusions in this section apply to all benefits. Although we may list a specific
                service as a benefit, we will not cover it unless we determine it is necessary for the
                prevention, diagnosis, care, or treatment of a covered condition. We do not cover the
                following:<br>

                billable to you by a participating dentist unless the dentist notifies you of your liability
                prior to treatment and you choose to receive the treatment. Participating dentists
                should document such notification in their records.);<br>

                <h4 class="modal-title" id="prod7Label">Accidental Death & Dismemberment Insurance (AD&D)</h4>
            </div>
            <p class="modal-body">
                <h3>What is AD&D Insurance?</h3>
                <p>In the unfortunate event that an insured person suffers a dismembered limb or
                passes away due to a covered accident, an AD&D insurance policy will pay the
                elected benefit amount based on the schedule of benefits. Per the Center for
                Disease Control and Prevention, Accidental deaths are the fifth leading cause
                of death in the United States, so obtaining AD&D insurance can protect your
                loved ones. In the event of an accidental death, benefits are payable to the
                    beneficiary.</p>
                <p>In addition to covering accidental death, AD&D policies pay if the insured
                suffers an accidental dismemberment. In most cases, the policy provides a
                scheduled benefit, or a specified portion of the death benefit, for
                dismemberment. For example, if the insured accidentally loses one hand or one
                foot, the policy might pay half of the death benefit. If the insured loses two or
                more limbs (any combination of arms and legs), then he or she might receive
                    the entire face value (death benefit) under the policy.</p>
                <h3>Who needs AD&D Insurance?</h3>
                <p>Accidental deaths are the fifth leading cause of death in the U.S. as well as
                in Canada. Accidents can happen in an instant, but the consequences can last
                a lifetime. Accidental death and dismemberment (AD&D) insurance gives you
                added financial security in sudden and tragic circumstances. AD&D insurance
                can be a valuable and low-cost addition to your current benefits package.
                AD&D Insurance helps safeguard your assets against the impact a serious injury
                or accidental death could have on them. It pays a benefit directly to you (or
                your named beneficiary) in the event of a covered accident, giving you access
                to the additional security you would need if a catastrophe affected your life.</p>
                <p>AD&D holds particular appeal for young workers, who statistically are more
                likely to die from accident than illness. The vast majority of these workers do
                not have individual disability insurance. AD&D benefits could help an insured
                recoup some of the income lost if he or she lost a limb, sight or hearing in an
                accident and was unable to work. ADD is especially valuable for people whose
                    jobs depend on their physical capabilities.</p>
                <h3>Who doesn’t need AD&D Insurance?</h3>
                <p>Because it is a safe guard against the unforeseen – a severe accident or even
                death – most do not think they need AD&D Insurance. But it is becoming an
                increasingly more desired insurance benefit to protect individuals and their
                family against the high medical bills associated with severe accidents. Some
                high paying professional jobs, company owners, and similar professional folks
                may have life insurance with riders that pay their beneficiaries in case of the
                    policyholders for accidental death.</p>
                <h3>What is normally included in AD&D Insurance?</h3>
                <p>We will pay the benefit for any one of the covered losses listed in the schedule
                of benefits, if the covered person suffers a covered loss resulting directly and
                independently of all other causes from a covered accident within the applicable
                time period specified in the schedule of benefits. If the covered person sustains
                more than one covered loss as a result of the same covered accident, benefits
                will be paid for the covered loss for which the largest available benefit is
                payable. If the loss results in death, benefits will only be paid under the Loss of
                Life benefit provision. Any loss of life benefit will be reduced by any paid or
                payable accidental dismemberment benefit. However, if such accidental
                dismemberment benefit equals or exceeds the loss of life benefit, no additional
                    benefit will be paid.</p>
                <p>Some of the covered accidents include traffic accidents, exposure, homicide,
                falls, heavy equipment accidents and drowning. Our accidental death &
                dismemberment plan provides 24-hour coverage no matter where a covered
                accident occurs, whether at work, home or away. AD&D applies in the event of
                a covered injury, paralysis or death resulting from a covered accident, with
                three plan options providing payouts at $25,000; $100,000; or $250,000
                    depending on the policy obtained and premium payment.</p>
                <p>Our standard AD&D Insurance plans provide coverage for:<br>
                • Loss of Life<br>
                • Loss of Speech<br>
                • Loss of Hearing<br>
                • Loss of a Hand, Foot or Sight<br>
                • Loss of Thumb and Index Finger on Either Hand<br>
                    • Loss of Movement<br></p>

                <p>Percentages of the policy’s principle sum will be paid out if the covered person
                loses a bodily appendage or sight because of an accident. Additionally, AD&D
                generally pays benefits for the loss of limbs, fingers, toes, and sight. The types
                of injuries covered and the amount paid vary by insurer and package, and are
                    explicitly enumerated in the insurance policy.</p>
                <p>
                    • Loss of Two or More Hands or Feet 100% of the Principal Sum<br>
                • Loss of Sight of Both Eyes 100% of the Principal Sum<br>
                • Loss of Speech and Hearing (in both ears) 100% of the Principal Sum<br>
                • Loss of One Hand or Foot 50% of the Principal Sum<br>
                • Loss of Sight in One Eye 50% of the Principal Sum<br>
                • Severance and Reattachment of One Hand or Foot 50% of the Principal Sum<br>
                • Loss of Speech 50% of the Principal Sum<br>
                • Loss of Hearing (in both ears) 50% of the Principal Sum<br>
                • Loss of Thumb and Index Finger of the Same Hand 25% of the Principal Sum<br>
                • Loss of all Four Finger of the Same Hand 25% of the Principal Sum<br>
                • Loss of all the Toes of the Same Foot 20% of the Principal Sum<br>
                </p>



                <h3>What is normally excluded in AD&D Insurance?</h3>
                <p>Death by illness, suicide, non-commercial radiation, war injury, and natural
                causes are generally not covered by AD&D. Similarly, death while under the
                influence of any non-prescribed drugs or alcohol is most likely exempt from
                coverage. Overdose with toxic or poisonous substances and injury of
                    an athlete during a professional sporting event may void the right to claim too.</p>
                <p>As with most life and health policies, AD&D policies do not cover claims
                resulting from illegal or criminal activities. They also exclude death by
                “malfunction of the body,” such as someone suffering a stroke or heart attack
                while driving. If the heart attack or stroke occurred before the accident and the
                    accident resulted from that bodily malfunction, the policy would not pay.</p>
                <p>AD&D insurance coverage has some important limitations. For example, many
                AD&D insurance policies do not pay benefits if the insured dies during surgery,
                has a mental or physical illness, has a bacterial infection or hernia or dies as the
                result of a drug overdose.</p>

                <h3>Definitions</h3>
                <p>• Loss of a Hand or Foot means complete Severance through or above the
                    wrist or ankle joint.<br>
                    • Loss of Sight means the total, permanent loss of all vision in one eye

                    • Loss of a Thumb and Index Finger of the Same Hand or Four Fingers of
                    the Same Hand means complete Severance through or above the
                    metacarpophalangeal joints of the same hand (the joints between the
