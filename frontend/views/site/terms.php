        <ul>
            <li>You are responsible for compliance with all local laws, if and to the extent your local laws are applicable.</li>
            <li>Further, the Terms and Conditions and the relationship between you and the Company shall be governed and construed in accordance with the laws of the State of Texas applicable to contracts entered into and fully performed in Texas (without regard to its conflicts of law principles that would cause the application of any other jurisdiction’s laws). With respect to any disputes or claims not subject to arbitration, you agree not to commence or prosecute any action in connection therewith other than in the state and federal courts located in the State of Texas, and you hereby consent to personal jurisdiction, and waive all defenses of lack of personal jurisdiction and forum non conveniens with respect to venue and jurisdiction, in the state and federal courts therein.</li>

        <h4>6.	ARBITRATION AND CLASS ACTION WAIVER</h4>
        <p>By using the Web Site in any way, you unconditionally consent and agree that: (1) any claim, dispute, or controversy (whether in contract, tort, or otherwise) you may have against the officers, directors and employees of the Company and its parent, subsidiaries, affiliates (all such individuals and entities collectively referred to herein as the “Company Entities”) arising out of, relating to, or connected in any way with the Web Site or the determination of the scope or applicability of this agreement to arbitrate, will be resolved exclusively by final and binding arbitration administered by JAMS and conducted before a sole arbitrator in accordance with the rules of JAMS; (2) this arbitration agreement is made pursuant to a transaction involving interstate commerce, and shall be governed by the Federal Arbitration Act (“FAA”), 9 U.S.C. §§ 1-16; (3) the arbitrator’s decision shall be controlled by the Terms and Conditions and any of the other agreements referenced herein that the applicable user may have entered into in connection with the Web Site; (4) the arbitrator shall apply Texas law consistent with the FAA and applicable statutes of limitations, and shall honor claims of privilege recognized at law; (5) there shall be no authority for any claims to be arbitrated on a class or representative basis; arbitration can decide only your and/or the applicable Company Entity’s individual claims; the arbitrator may not consolidate or join the claims of other persons or parties who may be similarly situated; (6) the arbitrator may award declaratory or injunctive relief only in favor of the individual party seeking relief and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by that party’s individual claim without affecting other individuals; (7) the arbitrator shall not have the power to award punitive damages against you or any Company Entity; (8) in the event that the administrative fees and deposits that must be paid to initiate arbitration against any Company Entity exceed $125 USD, and you are unable (or not required under the rules of JAMS) to pay any fees and deposits that exceed this amount, the Company agrees to pay them and/or forward them on your behalf, subject to ultimate allocation by the arbitrator. In addition, if you are able to demonstrate that the costs of arbitration will be prohibitive as compared to the costs of litigation, the Company will pay as much of your filing and hearing fees in connection with the arbitration as the arbitrator deems necessary to prevent the arbitration from being cost-prohibitive; and (9) with the exception of subpart (5) above, if any part of this arbitration provision is deemed to be invalid, unenforceable or illegal, or otherwise conflicts with the rules of JAMS, then the balance of this arbitration provision shall remain in effect and shall be construed in accordance with its terms as if the invalid, unenforceable, illegal or conflicting provision were not contained herein. If, however, subpart (5) is found to be invalid, unenforceable or illegal, then the entirety of this Arbitration Provision shall be null and void, and neither you nor the Company Entities shall be entitled to arbitrate their dispute. For more information on JAMS and/or the rules of JAMS, visit their web site at www.jamsadr.com.</p>
        <p>ACCORDINGLY, YOU ACKNOWLEDGE THAT YOU MAY NOT HAVE ACCESS TO A COURT, TO CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEDURES, OR TO A JURY TRIAL. Notwithstanding any other provision of the Terms and Conditions, the Company Entities may resort to court action for injunctive relief at any time. Further, notwithstanding any other provision of the Terms and Conditions, you and the Company Entities may agree to proceed in small claims court.</p>
