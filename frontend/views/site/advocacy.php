                <h1>Advice On Policies & Providers</h1>
                <p>Access to your own NAHC Healthcare Advocate and the invaluable services they provide begins at our Silver Membership Level. The advantages you’ll receive working one-on-one with our advocacy consultants will help guide you towards making well-informed buying decisions in the healthcare marketplace.</p>

You’ll be better equipped to handle the frustrations often experienced when making important care and treatment decisions. By helping you navigate the finer points, the confusing terms, and the critical distinctions between healthcare and plans and services, your Advocate pulls back the curtain on costs, simplifies the complex, and provides the transparency you need to choose the best policies and plans for you.</p>
                <p>Advisory Services Include:<br><br>
                    • Health plan review and assessment<br>
                    • Health counseling (life coaching for your medical needs)<br>

                <h1>Cost Control Guidance</h1>
                <p>When they’re not sufficiently managed and monitored, healthcare costs can easily spiral
                    out of control. Gleaning the most value from your healthcare dollar often involves close
                    oversight of the services rendered and procedures performed by medical practitioners.</p>

                <p>Through our partnership with The Karis Group, a leading professional-services firm
                    specializing in the healthcare sector, your NAHC Advocate has access to an array of
                    cost-containment services that provide major relief to consumers like you. These include
                    your choice of three distinct services that you can employ to not only ensure you receive
                    the high-quality healthcare services you deserve, but to make sure you do so at the
                    lowest cost possible. The money you’ll save on each individual surgical procedure
                    and medical treatment you receive will reduce the collective cost you’ll
                    ultimately pay when the bills start rolling in.</p>

                <p>Additionally, your Advocate works with you to reduce paperwork by consolidating the
                    number of forms and bills you’re expected to manage, and even provides prescription
                    price comparisons to help you save even more.</p>

                <p>Cost-Control Services Include:<br><br>
                    • Cost Navigator (cost-lowering procedures)<br>
                    • Billing & form consolidation services<br>
                    • Prescription price comparisons<br>
